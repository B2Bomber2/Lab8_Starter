1. How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
- Service Workers are similar to Graceful Degradation. Graceful Degradation is about building a website or app that has the latest and greatest features in the newest browsers, but falls back to a more barebones version in older browsers. Service Workers are not supported by every browser. So, the browsers that support them will have cache featuers, offline support, etc. However, browsers that do not support the Service Workers will use the traditional network requests.
